This is one of my more elaborate React JS projects. Here we have an e-store that lets you buy clothing products. Users can sign in and pay when checking out. Google's Firebase is used to handle user authentication and Stripe is used for managing checkout. Routers are used so that the user can navigate through multiple pages. Redux is used to handle and remember the states of the React components. SASS is used in replacement of CSS for a more stylish look.
